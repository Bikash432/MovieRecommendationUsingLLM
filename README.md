Movie Recommendation System
The Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent project built to recommend movies based on user preferences using machine learning algorithms. This project was developed for EHACKS 2023, a hackathon where our team earned a winning position! The system is powered by Netflix's movie dataset from Kaggle and various machine learning techniques to provide personalized recommendations.
